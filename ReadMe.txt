This project is to implement the sliding window protocol
in Data link layer of OSI reference model in computer network.

There are 3 modules Sender, Receiver and Channel.
Each of them runs on a seperate thread to simulate the 
synchronzing situation in real life.

Goto stdafx.h to modify the input configuration: such as Time delay of Sender and Receiver. We want to implement Flow control for difference in speed of the two ends.
